# SettingsStoreView
A Visual Studio Extension with a tool window that displays the contents of the settings store.

The "settings store" is like the registry -- in fact, behind the scenes, it's imported and managed as a registry hive.
In earlier versions of Visual Studio, you could use Regedit to view/edit the settings store. However, that's no longer possible (since Dev14, I think) since Visual Studio supports side-by-side installation with independent settings.
